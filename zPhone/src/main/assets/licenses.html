    IMSDroid is a free software licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license terms. As far as the commercial product using IMSDroid or doubango isn't a closed-source software and is compatible with GNU GPL terms, there is no license violation. However, if your commercial product is a closed-source software and you want to keep it closed, then you should get a non-GPL license.

We can provide a non-GPL version of all components used in both IMSDroid and doubango except for x264 library.

An alternative to x264 could be PacketVideo's H.264 implementation which is released under Apache License.Starting Doubango 1220 we support OpenH264 (BSD).

Owners of doubango licenses can reuse part or whole IMSDroid source code without any restriction.
